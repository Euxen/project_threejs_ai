# Project ThreeJS_AI

A simple 3D Shirt model utilizing ThreeJS library for modeling, lightning and camera. It currently has these three options to customize the shirt: color palette, image file upload and AI prompt (Dall-E 2).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Install Node.js
* Install Node package manager (npm)

### Installing

First would be to clone the repository to a local folder. And then open the same folder in your prefered IDE.  
Open your terminal, go to the folder that holds the project and enter the following command to start building the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

This should install all the dependencies that the project has. In the rare exception that there's an error, run the following:

```
npm audit fix
```

And finally, run the following command to start:

```
npm run dev
```

## Acknowledgments

* [Javascript Mastery] (https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) Even if the guide is months old, and obviously some libraries/APIs have depreciated some functions. 
It still served as a good base to start on. It obviously isn't a 1 to 1 project to what he has since I had to find and replace some depreciated functions with their newer 
counterparts, but it's the fact that I've started this project and managed to tough it out to finally have a working project on the web. Many thanks for the video.
